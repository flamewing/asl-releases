.SH NAME
.B plist \- list contents of output files generated by AS

.SH SYNTAX
.B plist
[ option(s) ] [ file(s) ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

PLIST is a program to list the contents of code output files generated by
AS, a cross assembler for a variety of microprocessors and -controllers.
PLIST takes only one argument: the name of the file to list.  If [ name ]
does not have an extension, the default extension '.p' will be added
automatically.  The output consists of a single line for each record in
the file, listing the target processor, target address space, number of
code/data bytes, and start/stop address.  Note that the difference between
the start and stop address need not equal the number of bytes, since there
are target processors whose memory is not bytewise-organized.  The records
that specify entry address and file creator have a different layout and
therefore have a little bit different look in PLIST's output.

PLIST accept multiple file arguments; processing of several files can be
done with a single call.

.SH COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS

To suppress the copyright message and reduce output to the necessary
minimum, add the command line argument
.TP
.B -q or -quiet

.SH NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT

plist supports national languages in the same way as AS.  See the manual
page for asl(1) for more information about this.

.SH RETURN CODES

.B plist
may return with the following codes:
.TP
.B 0
no errors.
.TP
.B 1
incorrect command line parameters.
.TP
.B 2
I/O-error.
.TP
.B 3
An input file had an incorrect format.

.SH EXAMPLES

To list the contents of a code file
.B file1.p,
use:
.PP
.B plist file1
.PP
There aren't more meaningful examples, as PLIST does not have
any command line parameters.

.SH TIPS

If PLIST is started without any argument, it will prompt for a file's name.

Borland-Pascal, and was ported to C and UNIX in 1996.
