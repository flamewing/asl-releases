Hello altogether,

this is the first very, very BETA release of the english AS manual.  I haven't
done the translation myself, it is the work of some other people around the
net who deserve my deep appreciation for this job.  As you will see, there
is a big gap somewhere between chapter 3 and the error messages, so there is
still room for lots of volunteers...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       1. Introduction
       ===============

This instruction is meant for those people who are already very 
familiar with Assembler and those who like to know how to work 
with AS.  It is rather a reference than a user's manual and so 
it does not try to explain neither the "language assembler" nor 
the processors.  In the bibliography I have listed further literature, 
which was substantial in the implementation of the different code 
generators.  There is no book I know where you can learn Assembler 
from the start, so on the whole I learnt this by "trial and error".

       1.1 License agreement
       ---------------------

Before we can go "in medias res", first of all the inevitable prologue:

I publish AS, in the present version, as "Public Domain". 
This means, the program and overlay files and also the 
utility and tool programs appended may be copied and use for free (of 
charge).  There exist no plan, to convert AS into a commercial or 
shareware program. This permission however is valid only under the 
following premises: 
1.) The start message of the programs - especially the copyright 
    message - must not be removed or overwritten 
2.) For copying and shipping there must be charged an expense 
    compensation of not more than D(E)M 20,-- (around US$ 14.00).

At request the source code of this program may also be emitted. 
Programs or derivates structured hereon must be passed-on under the 
same conditions as this program.

I explicitly encourage you to spread this program by disc or 
mailbox/bbs/network!

May be, you have got this program as enclosure to a commercial 
program. The license agreement for the commercial program in no case 
applies to AS. 

If you took so much pleasure in this assembler, that you like to 
send me some money I would ask you kindly to give the amount 
to Greenpeace.

I have been trying to make this program(s) as bug free as possible.  
But since there is principally no bug free software, I don't assume any 
warranty for the function of the assembler in a particular environment 
(hard or software) or liabilty for damages.  Naturally I will always 
be thankful for bug-reports or improvements and will work on the fixing.

To accelerate the error diagnose and correction, please enclose the 
following details to the bug report.

 - hardware:  - processor type  ( with/without coprocessor ) 
              - memory extension
              - video card
              - hard-disk type(s) and their interface(s)

 - software:  - operating system ( MS-DOS, Novell-DOS,DR-DOS, OS/2, 
                Windows ) and version 
              - resident (TSR) programs installed 
              - version of AS including the EXE-files date used 

 - if possible, the source file, in which the bug occurs 

You can contact me as follows:

  by mail :  Alfred Arnold
             Brîltalstr. 5a
             D-53773 Hennef (Sieg)
             Germany

  by E-Mail : direct: 
                      a.arnold@kfa-juelich.de
              via computerclub: 
                                ccac@rog.rwth-aachen.de

If you use the second e-mail-address, please enclose a hint that this 
message is directed to me (Alfred Arnold / Turbo-Pascal-group).  
Please, don't send any kind of advertisement, only personal letters 
are welcome by e-mail.  

If someone likes to meet me personally to ask questions and 
lives near Aachen (= Aix-la-Chapelle) will be able to meet me there.  
You can do this most probably on thursdays from 19.00 till 21.00 clock 
at the computerclub inside the RWTH Aachen (Eilfschornsteinstrasse 16, 
cellar philosophers building back side).  

Please don't call on me.  First, complex relations are extremely 
hard to discuss at phone.  Secondly, the telephone companies are 
already rich enough...

The latest german version of AS is resident at the following FTP-Servers:

 ftp.Uni-stuttgart.De
     directory   pub/systems/pc/lang/as

Whoever has no access to an FTP-Server can ask me for the assembler.  
Only enquiries containing a disc ( 1 piece 1.44 Mbyte or 1.2 MByte, 
for 360/720K-format 4/2 piece) and a matching, (correct) stamped 
cover (envelope) will be answered.  Don't send any money!

Now, after this inevitable introduction we can turn without care 
to the actual documentation:

       1.3. General assembler capabilities
       -----------------------------------

In contrast to normal assemblers, AS offers the possibility to 
generate code for totally different processors. At the moment the 
following processor families are implemented:

 - Motorola 68000..68030,683xx inkl. Koprozessor und MMU
 - Motorola DSP56000
 - Motorola/IBM MPC601/MPC505/PPC403

in work / planning / in consideration :

 - NEC 78K0
 - Toshiba TC9331
 - Intel MCS-251
 - Philips XA
 - Intel i960
 - Analog Devices ADSP21xx

I'm searching for the following materials at the moment:

 - Texas Instruments TMS320C4x
 - Texas Instruments TMS320C5x
 - Texas Instruments TMS320C8x (the CD free of charge is not 
   available any more and the price for the announced one is 
   a little bit too high, to implement something "just for fun")

unloved, but now, however, present :

- Intel 80x86, 80186, Nec V30&V35 incl. coprocessor 8087

The switching of the code generator is allowed even within one 
file, and that in any quantity!

The reason for these flexibility is, that AS has a history, that is to be 
recognize in the version number as well. AS was created as 
enlargement of a macro assembler for the 68000-family. On special 
request, I extended the original assembler so that it was able to 
translate 8051-mnemonics. On this way (decline ?!) from the 68000 to 
8051 all the others were created as by-products. So, the 
version number is not only marketing, but expresses really that this is 
no 1.0 version with beta-version bugs like MS-DOS 6.0 (which does not 
reduce the importance what has been said in part 1.1).

This flexibility implies an exotic code format, therefore I 
added some tools to work on. Their description is to be found in 
chapter 6.

AS is a macro assembler, which means that the programmer has the 
possibility, to define new "commands" by means of macros.  Additionally it 
masters conditional assembling.  Labels inside macros are 
automatically processed as local.

Symbols, for the assembler, may have either integer-, string- or 
floating point values. These will be stored - like interim values in 
formulas - with a width of 32- bit for integer values, 80-bit for 
floating point values and 255 characters for strings . For Intel micro 
controller there is the possibility to classify symbols by segmentation. So 
the assembler has a (small) possibility to recognize wrong access into 
address spaces.

The assembler does not know explicit limits in the nesting depth of 
include files or macros; a limit is only given by the program stack 
restricting the recursion depth.  Nor is there a limit for the 
symbol length, which is only restricted by the maximal line length. 

From version 1.38 on, AS is a multipass-assembler.  This pompous term 
means no more, than the fact that the number of passes through the 
source code must be not more than two. If the source code does not 
contain any foreward references, AS needs only one pass. In case AS 
recognizes in the second pass that it must use a command with a shorter 
or longer code, it needs a third (fourth, fifth...) pass to process all 
symbol references correct. There is nothing more behind the term 
"multipass", so it will not be used further more in this documentation.

After so much provise a bitter pill: AS does not generate a linkable code. 
An extension with a linker needs considerable effort and is not planned 
at the moment.

As regards "emitation of sources" the sources of AS are not presented in a 
form, which allowes easy understanding (== zero comments). So I 
will emit sources only in case somebody really wants to work on it (e.g. 
implementate AS into another computer system) and the derivate 
becomes again Public Domain. Particularly I want to prevent, that someone 
changes 5 lines (most popular the copyright entry) and sales the 
result commercially as "its own" program.

As regards the obviously inevitable question, if there will be a Windows 
version sometimes: In my opinion, it makes no sense to support a system 
additionally by programs, if it is obvious bullshit! For people, who do 
not like to work under DOS conditions or have urgent memory trouble, 
there is both, a DOS-DPMI- and a OS/2-version. Since not everybody needs 
them I publish those versions in separate packages.


       2. assembler usage
       ==================

       2.1. Start-up command, parameters
       ---------------------------------

AS is a command line driven program, i.e. all parameters and file 
options are to be given in the command line.  In order to prevent 
endless increase of memory requirement, the various code generator 
modules were displaced into an overlay file, whose existence is checked 
by the assembler immediatelly after program startup.  
If it does not finds them, the program run will be already stopped 
at this position...  The file AS.OVR should be always in the same 
directory as the AS.EXE-file.

Using overlays naturally results in slight overhead. AS tries to 
reduce this by using possibly existing EMS or XMS memory.  In case 
this results in trouble, your able to suppress the using of EMS or 
XMS by setting the enviroment variable USEXMS or USEEMS to n.  
e.g. it is possible to suppress the using of XMS by the command:

   SET USEXMS=n

Since AS handles all in and outputs via DOS (and therefore it should run 
also on not so much compatible PC's) and needs only a basic display 
control which is driven only by ANSI control sequences, during the assembly. 
In case you should see, in the messages displayed by AS, 
strange characters, your CONFIG.SYS is obviously lacking a line like this

   device=ansi.sys 

but the further functions of AS will not be infuenced hereby.  
Alternative you are able to suppres the output of ANSI sequences 
completely by setting the enviroment variable USEANSI to n.  

The parameters can be divided roughly into two categories: switches 
and file specifications.  Parameter of these two categories can be 
performed in any form and mixed-up in the command line.  The assembler 
evaluates at first all parameters and then assembles the specified 
files.  From this follow two things:

 - the spezified switches affect all specified source files. If 
   several source files with different switches shall be assembled, 
   this has to be done in separated runs.

 - it is possible to assemble more than one file in one shot and to 
   bring it to the top, it is allowed that the file options contain 
   wildcards.

Parameter switches are recognized by the assembler by starting on 
a slash (/) or hyphen (-).  At the moment the following switches 
are defined:

 -  l : sends assembler listing to console terminal (mostly screen).  
        In case several passes have to be done, the listing of any 
        pass is send to the console; in opposite to the next option.
 -  L : writes assembler listing into a file. The list file gets the 
        same name as the source file, only the extension is 
        replaced by LST .

 -  o : Sets the new name of the by AS generated code file.  If this 
        opton is used multiple, the names will be assigned, one after 
        the other, to the source files which have to be assembled.  
        A negation (see below) of this option in connection with a name 
        erases this name from the list.  A negation without a name 
        erases the whole list.

 -  c : SHARED-variables will be written in a format, which permits 
        an easy integration into a C-source file.  The extension of 
        the file is "H".
 -  p : SHARED-variables will be written in a format, which permits 
        easy integration into the CONST-block of a Pascal program. 
        The extension of the file is "INC". 
 -  a : SHARED-variables will be written in a format, which permits 
        easy integration into an assembler source file. The 
        extension of the file is "INC".

Concerning effect and function of the SHARED-symbols please see 
           chapters 2.6. or 3.8.1.

 -  w : suppress issue of warnings;

 -  E [file] : error messages and warnings produced by AS will be 
               diverted in a file. Instead of a file, the 5 standard 
               handles (STDIN..STDPRN) can also be specified as 
               !0 to !4 . Default is !2, that means STDERR.  If the 
               file option is left out, the name of the error file 
               is the same as of the source file, but with the 
               extension "LOG".

 -  q : This switch suppresses all messages of AS, the exceptions are 
        error messages and outputs which are are forced from the 
        source file.  The time needed for assembly is slighly reduced 
        hereby and if you call AS from a shell there is no redirection 
        required.  The disadvantage is that you may "stay in the dark" 
        for several minutes ... 

 -  h : hexadecimal numbers must be written in small instead of 
        capital letters. This option is primarily a question of 
        personal taste.

 -  i <path list> : issues a list of directories, in which the 
                    assembler automatically shall search for include 
                    files, in case it didn't find it in the current 
                    directory.  The different directories has to be 
                    separated by semicolons.

 -  u : calculate a list of areas which are occupied in the segments. 
        This option is effective only, in case a listing will be 
        produced. This option requires considerable additional 
        memory and computing performance. In normal operation it 
        should be switched off.

 -  C : generates a list of cross references.  There will be listed 
        which (global) symbols are used in files and lines.  
        This list' too, will be generated only, in case a listing is 
        produced.  This option occupies, too, additional 
        memory capacity during assembly.

 -  s : issues a list of all sections (see chapter 3.7).  The nesting 
        is indicated  by indentations (Pascal like).

 -  t : by means of this switch it is possible to separate single 
        components of the standard issued assembler-listing.  Which 
        part is assigned to any bit, you will find in the next but 
        one chapter, where the exact format of the assembler listing 
        is explained.

 -  D : defines symbols.  The symbols which are specified behind this 
        option and separated by commas are written in the 
        global symbol table before starting the assembly.  As default 
        these symbols are written as integer numbers within the 
        value TRUE, by means of adjusted equals sign, however, you can 
        select other values.  The expression following the equals 
        sign may include operators or internal functions, but NOT 
        any more symbols, even if these should have been defined before 
        in the list!  Together with the commands for conditional assembly 
        (see there) you may produce different program versions out of one 
        source file by command line inputs.


 -  A : writes the list of global symbols in another, more compact 
        form.  Use this option, if the assembler crashes with a stack 
        overflow because of long symbol tables.  Sometimes this option 
        can increase the processing speed of the assembler, but this 
        depends on the sources.

 -  x : if present, errors get an extended message, so the 
        identification of the fault should be easily possible.  What 
        kind of added information the error messages contains, is 
        given in the appendix inside the list of error messages. 
 -  n : If this option is set, the error messages will be issued 
        additionally with their error number (see appendix).  This 
        may used primary in shells or IDE's to make the identification 
        of errors easier by those numbers.
 -  P : instructs AS to write the source text processed by macro 
        processor and conditional assembly into a file.  Additional 
        blank- and pure comment lines are missing in this file.  The 
        extension of this file is "I". 
 -  M : by means of this switch AS generates a file, where the 
        definitions of source file macros not using the 
        NOEXPORT-option, are stored.  This new file has the 
        same name as the source file, only the extension is 
        modified into "MAC". 
 -  G : this switch defines, whether AS code should be produced or not. 
        If switched off, the processing will be stopped after the macro 
        processor. This switch is default activated (that logical, 
        otherwise you won't get a code file). This switch can be used in 
        connection with the switch P, if only the macro processor of 
        AS is wished to work.
 -  r : issues warnings, if situations occur, which need a further 
        pass. This information can be used to reduce the number of 
        passes. But be prepared for a big bunch!

If switches require no arguments, it is possible to specify several 
switches at one time, as in the following example :

 as test*.asm firstprog -cl /i c:\as\8051\include

All files TEST*.ASM as well as the file FIRSTPROG.ASM can be 
assembled, whereby listings of all files are displayed on the 
console terminal.  Additional sharefiles will be generated in the C-
format.  The assembler should search for additional include files 
in the directory C:\AS\8051\INCLUDE .

This example shows, that the assembler assumes "ASM" as default 
extension for source files.

Beside this statement in the command line permanent needed options 
can be written in the environment variable ASCMD . Someone who would 
like to have list files at any time and possesse a fixed include 
directory, can save a lot of keyboard work using the command:

 set ascmd=-L -i c:\as\8051\include

The environment options are worked out before the command line 
will be processed, so options in the command line can overdrive 
contradicting ones in the environment variable.

At very long path names it can it be very close inside the ASCMD-
variable.  For such cases a key-file may be the alternative, in which 
the options can be written in the same way as in the command line or 
the ASCMD-variable.  But this file may contain several lines with a 
maximum of 255 characters.  In that case it is important, that in 
options, which require an argument, both, switches and argument have 
to be in the SAME line.  AS gets informed of the name of the key-file 
by an "@" aheaded in the ASCMD-variable, e.g.

set ASCMD=@c:\as\as.key

In order to neutralize options in the ASCMD-variable (or in the 
key-file), only an aheaded plus sign is to be inserted before the 
option.  If in an individual case, a listing is not required, it is 
possible to erase it in this way:

as +L <file>

Naturally it is not consequentlly logical, to deny an option by a 
plus sign....  UNIX soit qui mal y pense.

In case that you like to start AS from another program or a shell and 
this shell hands over only lower-case or capital letters in the 
command line, the following workaround exists: if a tilde "~" is put 
in front of an option letter, the following letter is always 
interpreted as a lower-case letter.  Analoguely a "#" demands the 
interpretation as a capital letter. So examplationly the following 
transfomations result for:

 /~I ---> /i
 -#u ---> -U

In dependance of the action, the assembler ends with following 
return codes:

 0 : error free run, at the most warnings occurred 
 1 : the assembler displayed only start-up parameter and has 
     terminated immediately. 
 2 : errors occurred during assembly, no code file has been produced. 
 3 : a fatal error occured what led to immediate termination of the run. 
 4 : already while starting the assembler an error occurred. 
     This may be a parameter error or a faulty overlay-file. 


       2.2. Format of the input files
       ------------------------------

Like most assemblers AS expects exactly one command per line (blank 
lines naturally are allowed as well).  The lines must not be longer 
than 255 characters, additional characters are cut.

one single line has following format:

[label[:]] <command>[.attribute] [parameter[,parameter..]] [;comment]

The colon for the label is optional, in case the label starts in 
the first column ( the consequence is that a command never have to 
start in column 1).  You are forced to set the colon in case the 
does not start in the first column so that AS is able to distinguish 
it from a command. 

At 680x0, SH7000, TLCS-9000, M16 and also H8 an attribute attached 
to a command along by a dot serves as a description of the 
operand length. The following attribute letters are defined:

   attribute     arithmetical-logic instruction        jump instruction

       B              byte (8 bit)                         -------

       W/H            word (16 bit)                        -------

       L/D/W        longword (32 bit)                  16-bit-displacement

       Q          quadruple word (64 bit)                  -------

       S          single precision (32 bit)             8-bit-displacement

       D          double precision (64 bit)                -------

       X          extended precision (80/96 bit)       32-bit-displacement

       P          decimal floating point (80/96 bit)       -------

Attention: not all commands allow any operand length, and some 
commands have no attribute. For more exact studies consult a reasonable 
programmer's manual, e.g. [1] or equivalent.

###!!!

The number of the command parameters depends on the command and is 
pricipally located between 0 and 20.  The separation of the parameters 
from each other is to be performed only by commas (exception: DSP56000, 
its parallel data transfers are to be separated by blanks).  Commas, that 
are included in brackets or quotes, of course, are not taken into 
consideration.  

Instead of a comment at the end, the whole line can consist of 
comment; if it starts in the first column with a semicolon.

To separate the individual components you may use both, blanks and 
tabulators.


        2.3. Format of the listing
        --------------------------

The Listing, produced by AS using the command line options i or I, is 
roughly dividable into the following parts :

1. issue of the source code assembled;
2. symbol list;
3. arbitration list;
4. cross reference list.

The both last ones are only generated, if they have been demanded by 
additional command line options .

In the first part AS lists the complete contents of all source files 
inclusive the produced codes. A line of this listing has the following 
form:

[<n>] <line>/<address> <code> <source>

In the field "n" AS displays the include nesting level. The main file 
(the file, in that the assembly started), has the depth 0, an included 
file from there has depth 1 etc..  Depth 0 is not displayed.

In field "line" the line number of the referenced file is 
issued. The first line of a file has the number 1. The address, at 
which the generated code of this line is written, follows after the 
slash in field "address".

The code produced is written behind "address" in field "code", 
in hexadecimal notation. Depending on the processor type and actual 
segment the values are formated either as bytes or 16-bit-words. If 
more code is generated than the field can take, more lines will be 
generated, in which only this field is occupied.

Finally in the field "source" the line of the source file is issued in 
their original form.

The symbol table has a layout that regularly allowes to display, if 
possible, 80 columns. For symbols of "normal length" there is a double 
column output. If symbols exceed (with their name) the limit of 
40 columns (characters), they will be issued in a separate line. The 
output is done in alphabetical order.

The parts mentioned so far as well as the list of all macros/functions 
defined can be selectively masked in the complete listing. 
This can be done by the already mentioned command line switch -t. 
Internally a byte exists inside AS, whose bits represent, which parts 
are to be written. The bits are assigned to the following parts:

bit   part

 0    source file(s) + produced code
 1    symbol table
 2    macro list
 3    function list
 4    line numbering

All bits are set to 1 for default, when using the switch

-t <mask>

Bits set in <mask> are deleted, so that the respective listing 
parts are suppressed.  Accordingly it is possible to switch on single 
parts again with a plus sign, in case you has switched off too much 
with the ASCMD-variable... If someone wants to have, for example, 
only the symbol table, it is enough to write:

-t 2  

The arbitration list issues the occupied areas hexadecimally for any 
single segment.  If the area has only one address, only this is written, 
otherwise the first and last address.

The cross reference list issues any defined symbol in alphabetical 
order and has the following form:

 symbol <symol name> (=<value>,<file>/<line>): 
  file <file 1>:
  <n1>[(m1)]  ..... <nk>[(mk)]
  .
  .
  file <file l>:
  <n1>[(m1)]  ..... <nk>[(mk)]

For any symbol it is given, in which files and lines it has been used. 
If a symbol was used several times in the same line, this would 
be indicated by a number in brackets behind the line number. 
If a symbol was never used, it would not appear in the list; The same 
is true to a file, that would not appear in the list of a symbol, in 
case it was not referenced in the according file. 

Attention! AS is never interested in the length of the listing lines, 
i.e. it will not generate any line feeds!


        2.4. Symbol conventions
        -----------------------

Symbols are allowed to be up to 255 characters long (as hinted already 
in the introduction) and are being distinguished on the whole 
length, but the symbol names have to meet some conventions: 
Symbol names are allowed to consist of a random combination of 
letters, digits, underlines and dots, whereby the first character must 
not be a digit. The dot is only allowed to meet the MCS-51 notation of 
register bits and should -as far as possible- not be used in own symbol 
names.  To separate symbol names in any case the underline "_" and not 
the dot "." should be used .

The assembler is not case sensitiv, so it makes no difference, whether 
lower-case or capital letters are used.

The following symbols are predefined by the assembler:

name           type             status    meaning

TRUE           integer          predef.   logical "true"
FALSE          integer          predef.   logical "false"

CONSTPI        floating-point   predef.   Pi (3.1415.....)

VERSION        integer          predef.   version of AS in BCD-coding, 
                                          e.g. 1331 hex for version 1.33p1

DATE           String           predef.   date and 
TIME           String           predef.   moment of the assembly (start)

MOMCPU         integer          predef.   momentary target-CPU 
                                          (see command CPU)

MOMFILE        String           special   momentary source file
MOMLINE        integer          special   line number in source file
MOMPASS        integer          special   number of the running pass
MOMSECTION     String           special   name of the current section 
                                          or an empty string

* (Motorola,   integer          special   momentary program counter 
   Rockwell,
   Microchip)
$ (Intel,
   Zilog,
   Texas,
   Toshiba,
   NEC)
PC (Thomson)

The status "predef." means that the symbol is stored as a normal 
symbol in the global symbol table and can also be overwritten by SET 
(who else this ever needs..).  Special symbols, however, are realized via 
special conditions within the parser and cannot be overwritten.

Additionally some pseudo commands still define symbols, which allow an 
inquiry of the momentary value.  The descriptions of these are 
explained at the commands belonging to it.


        2.5. Formula expressions
        ------------------------

Most places, where the assembler expects number inputs, it is 
possible to specify not only simple symbols or constants, but also complete 
formula expressions.  The components of these formula 
expressions can be both, single symbols and constants.  The 
notation of integer constants can be done in different numerative 
systems:

                 Intel-mode           Motorola-mode
                 (Intel, Zilog,       (Rockwell, Motorola,
                  Thomson Texas,       Microchip, Thomson)
                  Toshiba,NEC)            

decimal          direct               direct

hexadecimal      followed by H        aheaded $

binary           followed by B        aheaded %

octal            followed by O        aheaded @

To prevent a misinterpretation of hexadecimal constants (as symbol 
names) in the Intel-mode, they must be started always by a digit; 
instead of e.g. F0H there must be written 0F0H.  The Motorola-mode 
doesn't know such problems (hihihi!). Integer constants can be written 
as ASCII-values, as well, like the following examples:

'A'    == $41
'AB'   == $4142
'ABCD' == $41424344

It is important, to write the characters in quotes, to 
distinguish them from the following string constant.

Floating point constants are to be written in the usual semilogarithmic 
notation, which is known in the most general form:

 [-]<integer digits>[.post decimal positions][E[-]exponent]

Attention! The assembler understands a constant at first as a integer 
constant and makes a floating-point format try only in case the first one 
failed.  If someone wants to enforce the evaluation as floating point 
number, so this can be done by dummy post decimal positions, e.g.  2.0 
instead of 2  .

String constants have to be included in quotation marks. In order to 
make it possible to write quotation marks and special characters without 
trouble in string constants, an "escape mechanism" has been worked in, 
which probably is familiar to C-programmers: 

The assembler understands a backslash (\) with a maximal three digit 
long number in the string as a character with the according 
decimal ASCII-value.  So it is possible to define by

\0

a NUL-character.

Some extraordinarily frequently used control characters, you can also 
achieve by using the following abbreviations:

\b : Backspace           \a : bell         \e : Escape
\t : tabulator           \n : linefeed     \r : carriage return
\\ : Backslash           \' or \H : apostrophe 
                         \" or \I : quotation marks

The identifications may become both, capitals as well as lower-case 
letters.

By means of this escape character you can also work even formula 
expressions into a string, if it is enclosed by ticked brackets: 
e.g. 

     message "root of 81 : \{sqrt(81)}"

results in

              root of 81 : 9

The assembler chooses with the help of the formula result type the 
correct output format, further string constants, however, are to be 
avoided in the expression. Otherwise the assembler will get mixed up 
at the transformation of capitals into lower case letters.

Except for the built-in of formula expressions, you can use this 
"escape-mechanism" as well in ASCII defined integer constants, 
like this:

     move.b   #'\n',d0

However, everything has its limits, because the parser with higher 
priority, which disassembles a line in op-code and parameters, does 
not know, what it is actually working with; e.g. here:

     move.l   #'\'abc',d0

After the third apostrophe it will not find the comma any more, 
because it presumes, that it is the start of a further character 
constant. An error message about a wrong parameter number is the result.  
An escape would be to write e.g., \i instead of \'.

The calculation provisional results originating within formula expression 
is to be done always by the highest available resolution, i.e. 
32 bit for integer numbers, 80 bit for floating point numbers and 255 
characters for strings. An possible test of value range violation is 
to be done only in the final result.  

The assembler provides the following operands for combination:

operand function              #operands integer fl.-point string rank

  <>    inequality                2      yes     yes       yes    14

"Rank" is the priority of an operator at graduations of expressions 
into subexpressions.  The operator with the highest rank will be 
evaluated at the very end.  The order of evaluation can be defined by 
new bracketing.

The compare operators deliver TRUE, in case the condition fits, 
and FALSE in case it doesn't.  For the logical operators an expression 
is TRUE, in case it is not 0, otherwise it is FALSE.

The mirror of bits probably needs a little bit of explanation: the 
operator mirrors the lowest bits in the first operand and leaves the 
higher priority bits unchanged.  The number of bits which is to be 
mirrored is given by the right operand and may be between 1 and 32 .

In addition to the operators the assembler defines another line of 
primarily tracendental functions with floating point arguments:

name      meaning              argument             result

SQRT      square root          arg >= 0             floating point

SIN       sine                 arg real             floating point
COS       cosine               arg real             floating point
TAN       tangens              arg <> (2*n+1)*Pi/2  floating point
COT       cotangent            arg <> n*Pi          floating point

ASIN      inverse sine         |arg| <= 1           floating point
ACOS      inverse cosine       |arg| <= 1           floating point
ATAN      inverse tangens      arg real             floating point
ACOT      inverse cotangent    arg real             floating point

EXP       expotential function arg real             floating point
ALOG      10 power of argument arg real             floating point
ALD       2 power of argument  arg real             floating point
SINH      hyp. sine            arg real             floating point

If a function expects floating point arguments, so this won't mean it is 
impossible to write e.g.

    wur2 equ sqrt(2)

In such cases an automatical type conversion is produced. In the reverse 
case the INT-function has to be applied to get a floating point number as 
integer.  When using this function, you have to pay attention that the 
result produced always is a signed integer and has so a value range of 
approximately +/-2.0E9.

For a correct conversion of lower case letter into capital letters a DOS-
version >= 3.30 is required.

        2.6. Sharefile
        --------------

This function is a by-product from the old pure 68000 models of AS, 
I have kept it inside in case someone really(?!) needs it.  
Basic problem is, to get certain symbols produced when assembling, 
because possibly someone would like to get access to the memory of 
the target system by this address information.  The assembler allowes 
to dispose symbol values externally, by means of SHARED-pseudo commands 
(see there).  For this purpose the assembler produces a text file with the required symbols and its values in the second pass.  Which may be 
incorporated by include into a higher-level language or another 
assembler program.  The format of the text file (C, Pascal or 
assembler) can be fixed by the command line switch p, c or a .

Attention! If none of the switches is given, no file will be 
generated and it makes no difference if SHARED-commands are in the 
source text or not!

When creating a Share-file AS does not check if a file with the 
same name already exists, such a file  will be simply overwritten.  
In my opinion a request does not make sense, because AS would 
ask at each run, if it should overwrite the old version of the 
Share-file, and that would be really annoying ...

3. Pseudo commands
==================

Not for all processors are all pseudo commands defined.  In brackets 
is noted, for which processor types this command legal is.

3.1. Definitions
-----------------

3.1.1.  SET and EQU ( all processors )
- - - - - - - - - -

SET and EQU allows the definition of constants without types, i.e. 
they will not assigned to a segment and their usage generates in no 
case a warning because 

of segment mixing. EQU defines constants which can not be modified (by 
EQU) again, but SET permits the definition of variables, which can be 
modified during the assembly.  This is useful e.g. at the allokation 
of resources like interrupt vectors, as shown in the following 
example:

VecCnt set 0           ; somewhere at the beginning

.
.
.

DefVec macro Name      ; a new vector occupy Name  equ VecCnt
VecCnt set VecCnt+4
endm

.
.
.


DefVec Vec1            ; results in Vec1=0
DefVec Vec2            ; results in Vec2=4

internally constants and variables will be stored identically, the 
only difference is, that it can be redefined by SET and not by EQU.  
It is therefore possible to define a symbol with EQU and to change it 
with SET (even if this is not its real business).

With EQU it is possible to define both, floating-point- as well as 
integer constants, e.g.

IntTwo     equ   2
FloatTwo   equ   2.0

Some processors unfortunately have already a SET-command. At these 
types EVAL must be used instead of SET.


3.1.2. SFR and SFRB  ( MCS-51, SFR also PIC, ST62xx, Z8, 6804) 
- - - - - - - - - -

These commands act like EQU, but the so defined symbols are assigned 
to the direct addressable data segment, i.e. it serves preferential to 
the definition of RAM-cells and (such as the name lets guess) hardware 
registers in the address range of 0..0ffh.  The difference between SFR 
and SFRB is, that SFRB marks the register as bit addressable, and so 
the assembler generates in addition 8 symbols, which will be assigned 
to the bit segment and the names sustain xx.0 to xx.7, e.g.
PSW    sfr    0d0h      ; results in PSW = D0H (data segment)

PSW    sfrb   0d0h      ; results in extra PSW.0 = D0H (bit)
                        ;               to PSW.7 = D7H (bit)

Attention! The assembler is not interested at any rate, if a by SFRB 
defined register is a real bit addressable register, the programmer 
has to take care for those things!

The address values may have 0 to 255 .

SFR is also allowed with the PICs and the ST62xx-family, but at the 
16C5x the address range is limited from 0 to 31.


3.1.3. XSFR and YSFR  (DSP56000)
- - - - - - - - - - - 

Even the DSP56000 has a few peripheral register memory-mapped inside 
the RAM, but the affair becomes complicated, because there are two 
data areas, the X- and Y-area. This architecture allows on the one 
hand a higher parallelity, but forces on the other hand to divide the 
normal SFR-command into the two above mentioned variations.  This 
works identically to SFR, just that XSFR defines a symbol in the X-
addressing space and YSFR the corresponding one in the Y-addressing 
space. The allowed value range is 0..$ffff.


3.1.4. LABEL  (all processors)
- - - - - - - 

The function of the LABEL-command is identically to EQU, but the 
symbol becomes not typeless, it gets the attribute "code".  LABEL is 
needed exact for that purpose: Labels are normally local in macros, 
that means not accessible outside of a macro.  With an EQU-command you 
can get out of it nicely, but the phrasing

<name> label   $

generates a symbol with correct attributes.


3.1.5.  BIT  ( MCS-51 )
- - - - - -

BIT operates analoge to EQU, just the symbol becomes assigned to the 
bit addressable segment.  The allowed value range is 0..255.

Example:

my_carry       bit     PSW.7



3.1.6. PORT  ( 8080/8085/8086, Z80, 3201x, TLCS-47 )
- - - - - -

PORT works analoge to EQU, just the symbol becomes assigned to the 
i/o-address range. Allowed values are 0..7 at the 3201x, 0..65535 at 
the 8086 and 0..255 at the rest.

Example : a PIO 8255 is located at address 20H:

PIO_port_A     port    20h
PIO_port_B     port    PIO_port_A+1
PIO_port_C     port    PIO_port_A+2
PIO_ctrl       port    PIO_port_A+3


3.1.7.  CHARSET  ( all processors )
- - - - - - - -

single board systems, especially when driving LCDs, using frequently 
another character sets then ASCII. So it is probably pure chance that 
the umlaut coding correspondes with the one inside the command. To 
avoid now faulty manual encoding, the assembler contains a cross-
reference for characters which assignes for each source-code a target 
character.  To modify this table (which initial translates 1:1) you 
has to use the command CHARSET. This command expects a range 
specification as first or first/second parameter for the characters to 
become translated. The last parameter is the range, into that the 
characters shall become translated. To the clear up, two examples:

       CHARSET         'Ñ',128

That means the target system codes the 'Ñ' into the number 128 (80H). 
In case that the target system did not support lower-case letters, by


       CHARSET         'a','z','A'

all lower-case letters will be translated automatically into the 
matching capital letters.

Attention! CHARSET does not affect just only the stored string 
constants in the memory, but also as "ASCII" formulated integer 
constants. This means that an already modified cross-reference can 
lead into other results in the above mentioned examples!


3.2. Code modification
----------------------


3.2.1.  ORG  ( all processors )
- - - - - -

ORG allows the loading of the internal address counter (of the 
assembler) with a new value. The value range is depending from the 
momentary selected segment and from the processor type :

               680x0   6502,6800   6805    MCS-48    MCS-51   8080/8085

In case that different variations in a processor family have 
differentially big address ranges, the maximal range is listed for each.

In the most times ORG is needed to give the code a new starting address 
or a different one, but not to put coherent code parts into one source 
file.


3.2.2.  CPU   ( all processors )
- - - - - -

This command fixes for which processor the further code shall be 
generated.  The commands of the other processor families are then not 
accessable and will produce an error message!

the processors can be distinguished roughly in families, inside the 
families different types serves additionally to the detailed 
distinction:

a) 68008 --> 68000 --> 68010 --> 68012 --> 68020 --> 68030

You can found the differences in this family in added commands and 
addressing modes (from 68020 on).  A small exception is the 68030, where 
two commands are absent: CALLM and RTM.

b) 6502 --> 65C02 / MELPS740

The CMOS-version defines some additional commands, as well as at a 
number of some commands addressing modes were added, which are not 
possible at the 6502.  The Mitsubishi micro controller in opposite 
expand the 6502 instruction set primarily to bit operations and 
multiplication / division instructions.  Except for the unconditional 
jump and commands to the incrementation/decrementation of the 
accumulator the instruction extensions are different.

c) 8021, 8022, 8039, 80C39, 8048, 80C48, 8041, 8042

At the ROM-less versions 8039 and 80C39, the commands forbidden which 
are using the BUS (port 0).  The 8021 and 8022 are special versions with 
strongly emaciated (shrinked) instruction set, for which the 8022 has 
two A/D- converter and contains the (to it belonging) control-commands.  
It is possible to transfer the CMOS-versions with the IDL-command into a 
stop mode with lower current consumption.  The 8041 and 8042 have some 
additional instructions for controlling the bus interface, but there for 
a few other commands are omitted.  Moreover is at these processors the 
code (addressing) area not external extendable, and so AS limits the 
code segment at these processors up to 1 or 2 kByte.

d) 8051, 8052 and 80515

Over here the assembler makes no distinction, it only manages the 
differences in the variable MOMCPU (see below), which you can check by 
the IF-commands.

e) 8080 and 8085

The 8085 knows the additionally commands RIM and SIM for controlling the 
interrupt enable mask and the two i/o-pins.

f) Z80-->Z180

For the present here are only the additional Z180-commands defined, i.e. 
the Z180-MMU is still ignored.

g) 6800-->6301-->6811

The 6301 defines only new commands, in opposite the 6811 provides beside 
additionall commands another index register Y for addressing.

h) 6809 and 6805

These processors are partially source code compatible to the other 
68xx-, but have got another binary code format and a clearly restricted 
(6805) or extended (6809) instruction set .

i) 16C54 --> 16C55 --> 16C56 --> 16C57

These processors differ by the available code (addressing) area, i.e. by 
the address, at which the assembler reports an overrun.

j) 17C42

k) 16C84

l) 8086-->80186-->V30-->V35

Over here just new commands are added again.  The respective 8-bit CPU's 
are because of of their command compatibility unperformed. So there is 
to choose for a 8088-system e.g. 8086 .

m) 96C141, 93C141

These two processors represent the two variations of the processor 
family TLCS-900 and TLCS-900L.  The differences of this two variations 
will be discussed exactly in section 4.6 .

n) ST6210/ST6215-->ST6220/ST6225

The only distinction AS takes between the two pairs, is the smaller 
addressing space (2K instead 4K) at the first ones.  The detailed 
distinction is done to provide an automatic distinction in the source 
file, which respective hardware is availible (analoge to the 
8051/52/515).

o) 32010-->32015

The TMS32010 owns just 144 byte internal RAM, and so AS addresses in the 
data segment just up to this limits.  For the 32015 is this restriction 
not valid, the full range can be used from 0..255 .

p) Z8601

q) MELPS7700, 65816

Beside a "16-bit-version" of the 6502-instruction set these processors 
offer several command extensions.  but These are in the most cases 
different, because each orientates itselve at its respective 8-bit model 
(65C02 or MELPS-740). Partly other Mnemonics will also used for same 
commands.

r) 90C141

s) 7810-->78C10

The NMOS-version owns no stop-mode; the respective command and the ZCM-
register are omitted and also some reset values inside the registers are 
different.

T) 6804

u) 56000

v) 87C00, 87C20, 87C40, 87C70

The processors of the TLCS-870 have indeed an identical CPU-kernel, but 
depending on the type different peripherals.  In part registers with the 
same name were located at different addresses. The file STDDEF87.INC 
uses, analoge to the MCS-51-family, the here possible distinction, to 
provide automatically the correct symbol set.

w) 47C00-->470C00-->470AC00

These three variations of the TLCS-47-family have differently big RAM-
and ROM-address ranges, by which several commands for bank switching 
will be added or suppressed.


At the CPU-command, the processor type must be specified as simple 
constant , a calculation like:

       CPU     68010+10

is non-permissible.  Valid calls are e.g.

CPU  8051

or

CPU 6800

It makes no difference, which processor type is set, the integer 
variable MOMCPU contains the actually status as a hexadecimal number.  
For the 68010 is e.g. MOMCPU=$68010, for the 80C48 MOMCPU=80C48H, 
because AS can not interpret letters except A..F as hexadecimal number, 
so these letters must must be omitted at the hex notation; e.g. for the 
Z80 is MOMCPU=80H.

You can use this advantageous feature, to generate different code 
depending on processor type.  e.g. the 68000 still didn't know a command 
for subroutine return with stack correction.  With the variable MOMCPU 
you can define a macro, that uses or emulate the correct command 
depending on the processor type:

myrtd  macro   disp
       if      MOMCPU<$68010   ; emulate for 68008 & 68000 
        move.l (sp),disp(sp)   
        lea    disp(sp),sp     
        rts                    
       elseif                  
        rtd    #disp           ; direct use from 68010 on
       endif
       endm


       cpu     68010
       myrtd   12              ; results in RTD #12

       cpu     68000
       myrtd   12              ; results in MOVE.. / LEA.. / RTS

The assembler switches implicit, with the CPU-command, the current 
segment to code again, because this is the only segment that is defined 
for all processors.

Default processor type is 68000.



3.2.3. SUPMODE, FPU, PMMU  ( 680x0, FPU also 8086..V35,
- - - - - - - - - - - - -    SUPMODE also TLCS-900 )

By the use of these three switches in the 68000-mode it can be defined, 
what parts of the instruction set may not be used, because the necessary 
preconditions are not given in the following code part.  As parameter 
for these commands may either ON or OFF be given, the actual status can 
be read-out of a variable which is either TRUE or FALSE.

The commands detail mean following:

SUPMODE: allows or prohibites commands, for whose execution the 
         processor has to be within the supervisor mode.  The status 
         variable is called INSUPMODE.

FPU    : allows or prohibites the commands of the numerical coprocessor 
         68881 or 68882.  The status variable is called FPUAVAIL.

PMMU   : allows or prohibites the commands of the memory management unit 
         68851 or the built-in MMU of the 68030 .  
         Attention! The 68030-MMU allows just a relative small subset of 
         the 68851-commands.  The assembler did not test this! The 
         status variable is called PMMUAVAIL.

The using of in this manner prohibited commands will generate a warning 
in SUPMODE, at PMMU and FPU a real error message.

FPU is also permitted in the 80x86-family and switch to the 
corresponding  8087-instruction set.


3.2.4. MAXMODE (TLCS-900)
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

The processors of the TLCS-900-family be able to work in 2 modes, the 
minimum- and maximum-mode.  Depending on the actual mode, a little bit 
different benchmark figures are valid to the running mode and the 
assembler. Along with this command and the parameter ON or OFF, AS is 
informed that the following code has to run in maximum- or minimum-mode.  
The actual setting can be read-out from the variable INMAXMODE. 
Presetting is OFF, i.e. minimum-mode.


3.2.5.  SEGMENT ( all processors )
- - - - - - - -

Certain micro controllers and signal processors know various address 
ranges, which are not mixable with each other and require for each also 
different commands for addressing.  To manage also these ones, the 
assembler provides various program counter, you can switch among them 
to-and fro by the use of the SEGMENT-command.  This allows both, to 
define by INCLUDE merged subroutines as well as in the main program 
needed data at the location, at which it shall be used.  
In detail the following segments will be managed by the following names:

CODE    : program code;
DATA    : direct addressable data (and also SFRs); 
XDATA   : data in external connected RAM or 
          X-addressing space at the DSP56000;
YDATA   : Y-addressing space at the DSP56000;
IDATA   : indirect addressable (internal) data; 
BITDATA : part of the 8051-internal RAM, which is bitwise addressable;
IO      : i/o-address range.

See also section 3.2.1. (ORG) for detailed information about address 
range and initial values of the segments. Depending on the processor 
family not all segment types will be permitted.

The bit segment is manages in the way, as if it would be a byte segment, 
i.e. the addresses will be incremented at 1 per bit.

to say it clearly once again: all segments except code serves only the 
address management, i.e. you can define no code or constants therein.  
Permissible are only commands, which reserve memory (DS, DB ?...).

Labels get the same type as attribute as the segment have in which it 
was defined.  So the assembler has a limited possibility to check, if 
you access by the wrong commands to symbols of a certain segment.  In 
such cases the assembler issues a warning.

Example:

       CPU     8051            ; MCS-51-code

       segment code            ; test code

       setb flag               ; no warning
       setb var                ; warning : wrong segment

segment data

var    db ?

       segment bitdata

flag   db ?



3.2.6.  PHASE and DEPHASE   ( all processors )
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

In some applications (especially Z80-systems) the code must shifted into 
another address range, before use.  If the assembler didn't know about 
this, it would align all Labels to the load adresses (not the start 
address).  The programmer is then forced to write jumps within this area 
either independent of location or has to add the offset at each symbol 
"on foot".  The first one is at some processors not possible, the last 
one extremly error-prone. 
With the commands PHASE and DEPHASE it is possible, to inform the 
assembler at which address the code will be really executed in the 
target system:

       phase   <address>

Informs the assembler that the following code shall be executed at the 
specified address.  The assembler calculates thereupon the difference to 
the real program counter and adds this difference at following 
operations:

 - address value in the listing
 - filing of lable values
 - program counter references in relative jumps and address expressions
 - request of the program counter with the symbols * or $

this "shifting" becomes switched off by the command

dephase

The assembler manages phase values for all defined segments, although 
this command pair just makes sense especially in code segments.  



3.2.7.  SAVE and RESTORE  (all processors)
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

The command SAVE forces the assembler to puts the content of following 
variables  to an internal stack:

 - momentary selected processor type (set by CPU); 
 - momentary active memory area (set by SEGMENT);
 - Flag, whether Listing is switched on- or off (set by LISTING);
 - Flag, if expansions of following macros shall be issued in the 
         Listing (set by MACEXP).

The counterpart RESTORE downloades the at least saved status of this 
stack again.  These two commands were primarily defined for 
includefiles, to change the above mentioned variables in any way inside 
of these files, without loosing their original content.  This may be 
helpfull e.g. in includefiles with own, fully debugged subroutines, to 
switch the listing generation off:

       SAVE            ; save old status 

       LISTING  OFF    ; save paper 

       .               ; the actual code
       .

       RESTORE         ; restore

In opposite to a simple LISTING OFF .. ON-pair, the correct status will 
be produced again, in case the listing generation was switched off 
already before.

The assembler checks if the number of SAVE-and RESTORE-commands 
corresponds and delivers error messages in the following cases:

 - RESTORE, but the internal stack is empty;
 - the stack not empty at the end of a pass.


3.2.8. ASSUME  (various)
- - - - - - -


8086
....

The 8086 is able to address data in all segments in one command, but 
needs however so-called "segment-prefixes", if another segment register 
then DS shall be used.  In addition it is possible, that the DS-register 
is adjusted to another segment, e.g. to address longer routes of data in 
the code segment. AS didn't make a  meaning check of the code, so it has 
to informed via this command to what segments the segment registers 
point at the moment, e.g.:

       ASSUME  CS:CODE, DS:DATA    .

To all four segments of the 8086 (SS,DS,CS,ES), assumptions can be 
assigned in this manner.  This command produces NO code, so you has to 
load values really into the segment registers and this must be done by 
the program.

The using of this command has the result, that AS is able to put ahead 
automatically prefixes at sporadic accesses into the code segment, or on 
the other hand, AS can inform you that the DS-register was shifted and 
you can save explicit CS:-instructions.

Valid arguments behind the colon are CODE, DATA und NOTHING. The last 
value informs AS that the segment registers contains no useable value 
(for AS).  Preinitialized are the following ASSUMEs:

CS:CODE, DS:DATA, ES:NOTHING, SS:NOTHING


MELPS7700/65816
...............

These processors include a lot of registers, whose contents AS must know 
to generate the correct code.  It is a matter of the following register:
name   meaning                 value range     default

DT     data bank               0-$ff           0
PG     code-bank               0-$ff           0
DPR    direct adr. page        0-$ffff         0
X      width of indexregister  0 or 1          0
M      width of accumulator    0 or 1          0

To avoid endless repetitions, please take a look to Chapter 4.11, the 
useage of this values is decribed there.  The handling is identically to 
the 8086, i.e. several values can also set at once and no code is 
generated, which can load the register with values.  This has to be done 
again and only by the programmer!


ÊPD78(C)10
..........

This processors have a register (V), along with its assistance the 
"Zeropage", i.e. of the memory cells which are addressable by just one 
byte, is able to locate free in the memory, within page limits.  
By reasons of comforts you don't want to work with expressions such as

inrw    Lo(counter)

so AS takes over this job, but only under the premise, that it is informed 
via the ASSUME-command about the content of the V-register.  If a 
command with short addressing is used, it will be checked if the upper half 
of the address expression correspond with the expected content.  A warning will be issued if this is not correct.


ST62xx
......

The micro controller of the ST62-family are able to insert a part 
(64 byte) of the code area into the data area, e.g. to load constants 
from the ROM.  This means also, that at one moment only one part of the 
ROM can be addressed.  Which part it is, is assigned by a certain 
register.  AS can not check direct the content of this register, but it 
can be informed by this command that a new value have been assigned to the 
register.  AS then can test and if necessary warn, in case addresses of 
the code segment will be accessed, which are not located in the 
"announced" window.  The variable VARI have e.g. the value 456h, so 

ASSUME ROMBASE:VARI>>6

places the AS-internal variable up to 11h, and an access to VARI generates 
an access to address 56h in the data segment.

Instead of a symbol it can also be stated a simple NOTHING, e.g. if the bank-
register is used temporary as memory cell. This value is also the presetting.


TLCS-47
.......

The direct data address area of this processors (it makes no difference 
whether you address direct or via HL-register) have an amount of only 256 
Nibbles.  Because the "better" family members have got up to 1024 Nibbles 
RAM on chip, Toshiba was forced to introduce a banking mechanism via the 
DMB-register.  AS manages the data segment as a continuous addressing space 
and checks at any direct addressing, if the address is in the momentary 
active bank.  The bank AS momentary expected can be fixed by means of

ASSUME  DMB:<0..3>

The default value is 0.

3.3. Data definitions
----------------------

the over here described commands overlap itself partly in their 
functionality, but defines each processor family other names for the same 
function.  To with the standard assemblers conformable to remain, was this 
form of the implementation selected.



3.3.1.  DC[.Size]       ( 680x0, DSP56000 )
- - - - - - - - -  
this command places a or several constants of the with 
the 68000 by  attribute certain of the type in the memory .  The 
attributes correspond the in section 2.2 defined, additionally is for byte 
constants the possibility availible, string expressions in the memory write 
into, like e.g.

String  dc.B "Hello world!\0"

the parameter number may between 1 and 20 lie.

Should the byte count odd be, so will from the assembler automatically 
another byte attached, to the word alignment of data obtainable .

With this command stored decimal floating point numbers ( DC.X ...) be able 
to  the whole area of the extended precision cover, to pay attention to is 
thereby , that the momentary available coprocessors at the read of such 
constants the thousand digit of the exponent ignore!

default attribute is W, that means 16-bit-integer numbers.

At the DSP56000 is the data type to integer numbers fixed (a attribute is 
therefore neither necessary nor allowed), the in the range -8M..16M-1 lie 
may.   String constants are also allowed, whereby for each three characters 
in one word packed be.


3.3.2.  DS[.Size]       ( 680x0, DSP56000 )
- - - - - - - - -

with to this command lets once memory capacity for the stated number in the 
attribute described numbers allocate.  So allocated

DS.B 20

e.g. 20 bytes memory,

DS.X    20

but 240 byte !

the alternate meaning is the alignment of the program counter, being with 
the value input 0 reached will.  In this way will with

DS.W 0

the program counter to the next even address rounded off, with

DS.D 0

in opposite to the next double word limit.  Possible thereby untouched 
memory cells haven't  with zeros or NOPs filled, but undefined.

Target for the operand length is - as usual - W, just 16 bit.

At the 56000 is the operand length to words (a 24 bit) fixed, attributes 
there are therefore such as  DC also here not.


3.3.3. DB,DW,DD,DQ and DT ( Intel, Zilog, Toshiba, NEC ) - - - - - - - - - - 
- - -

this commands are so to speak the Intel-counterpart to DS and DC , and 
such as not else to expect is the logic a little bit differently: for one 
will the identification the operand length into the Mnemonic put :

DB: byte or ASCII-String such as at DC.B
DW: 16-bit-integer
DD: 32-bit-integer or single precision
DQ: double precision   ( 64 bit )
DT: extended precision ( 80 bit )

On the other hand is done by the distinction, if constant definition or 
reserved memory, within operand.  A reservation of memory will by a ? marked:

db ? ; reserves a byte
dw ?,? ; reserves memory for 2 words (=4 byte) dd -1 ; puts the constant -1 (
FFFFFFFFH) in !

reserved memory and constant definition must not in one instructions mixed 
be:

db "hello",? ; --> error message

additionally is still the DUP-Operator permitted, that the repeated filing 
of constant sequences or the reservation whole memory blocks permits:

db 3 dup (1,2) ; --> 1 2 1 2 1 2
dw 20 dup (?) ; reserves 40 byte memory.

As you see can, must the DUP-argument put in brackets be, may for that  
also again from various parts consist,  itselves also again DUPs can be...
All operates that means recursive. DUP is the only place, at which you with 
an other limit of the assembler in touch get in can: maximum be able to 1024 
byte code or data in one line generated be.  This gets itself not to the 
reservation of memory, just  the definition of constant arrays !
In order with the M80 compatible to be, may in the Z80-mode instead of DB / 
DW as well as DEFB / DEFW are written.


3.3.4.  BYT  ( 6502,68xx )
- - - - - -

along with that command becomes in the 65xx/68xx-mode byte constants or 
ASCII-Strings writen, it corresponds to also DC.B at the 68000 or DB at 
Intel.

A. Error messages of AS
========================

Here the list of the error messages emitted by AS is given. Each error
message is described by:

- the internal error number (it is displayed only if AS is used with the
                              -n option)

- the text of the error message

- error type:  Warning   : informs the user that a possible error was
                           found, or that some inefficient binary code
                           could be generated. The assembly process is not
                           stopped.

               Error     : an error was detected. The assembly process
                           continues, but no binary code is emitted.


               Fatal     : unrecoverable error. The assembly process is
                           terminated.

- reason of the error    : the situation originating the error.

- argument:  a further explanation of the error message.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

0     useless displacement

      Type:     warning
      Reason:   680x0, 6809 and COP8 CPUs: an address displacement was
                given a value of 0. An address without displacement is
                generated, and a convenient number of NOPs are emitted,
                to avoid phasing errors.
      Argument: none


10    short addressing possible

      Type:     warning
      Reason:   680x0-, 6502 and 68xx CPUs: a given memory location can be
                reached using short addressing. A short addressing
                instruction is emitted, together with the required
                number of NOPs, to avoid phasing errors.
      Argument: none


20    short jump possible

      Type:     warning
      Reason:   680x0- and 8086 CPUs can execute jumps using a short or long
                displacement. If a shorter jump was not required, in the
                first pass room for the long jump is reserved. Then the code
                for the shorter jump is emitted, and the remaining space is
                filled with NOPs, to avoid phasing errors.
      Argument: none


30    no sharefile created, SHARED ignored

      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A SHARED directive was found, but on the command line no
                options were specified, to generate a shared file.
      Argument: none


40    FPU possibly cannot read this value (>=1E1000)

      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The BCD- floating point format used by the 680x0- FPU
                allows such a large exponent, but according to the last
                databooks, this is not exactly interpreted. The
                corresponding word is assembled, but the associated
                function is not expected to produce the correct result.
      Argument: none


50    privileged instruction
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A Supervisor-mode directive was used, that was not preceded
                by an explicit SUPMODE ON directive
      Argument: none


60    distance of 0 not allowed for short jump (NOP created instead)
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A short jump with jump distance equal to 0 is not allowed
                by 680x0 processors, since the associated code word is
                used to identify long jump instruction. Instead of a
                jump instruction, AS emits a NOP
      Argument: none


70    symbol out of wrong segment
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The symbol used as an operand comes from an address space
                that cannot be addressed together with the given instruction
      Argument: none


75    segment not accessible
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The symbol used as an operand belongs to an address space
                that cannot be accessed with any of the segment registers of
                the 8086
      Argument: The name of the unaccessible segment

80    change of symbol values forces additional pass
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A symbol changed value, with respect to previous pass. This
                warning is emitted only if the -r option is used.
      Argument: name of the symbol that changed value.

90    overlapping memory usage
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The analysis of the symbol table shows that part of the
                program memory was used more than once. The reason can be an
                excessive usage of ORG directives.
      Argument: none

100   none of the CASE conditions was true
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A SWITCH...CASE directive without ELSECASE clause was
                executed, and none of the CASE conditions was found true.
      Argument: none

110   page might not be addressable
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The symbol used as an operand was not found in the memory
                page defined by an ASSUME directive (ST62xx, 78(C)10).
      Argument  none

120   register number must be even
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The CPU allows to concatenate only register pairs, whose
                start address is even (RR0, RR2, ..., only for Z8).
      Argument: none

130   obsolete instruction, usage discouraged
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The instruction used, althougth supported, was superseded by
                a new instruction. Future versions of the CPU could no more
                implement the old instruction.
      Argument: none

140   unpredictable execution of this instruction
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The addressing mode used for this instruction is allowed,
                however a register is used in such a way that its content
                cannot be predicted after the execution of the
                instruction.
      Argument:  none

150   localization operator senseless out of a section
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A previously defined parenthesis must be used, so that it is
                explicitly referred to the local symbols used in the
                section. When the operator is used out of a section, there
                are no local symbols, because this operator is useless in
                this context.
      Argument: none

160   senseless instruction
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The instruction used has no meaning, or it can be
                substituted by an other instruction, shorter and more
                rapidly executed.
      Argument: none

170   unknown symbol value forces additional pass
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   AS expects a forward- definition of a symbol, i.e. a symbol
                was used before it was defined. A further pass must be
                executed. This warning is emitted only if the -r option was
                used.
      Argument: none

180   address is not properly aligned
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   An address was used, that is not an exact multiple of the
                operand size. Although the CPU databook forbids this, the
                address could be stored in the instruction word, so AS
                simply emits a warning.
      Argument: none.

190   I/O-address must not be used here
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   The addressing mode or the address used are correct, but the
                address referst to the peripheral registers, and it
                cannot be used in this circumnstance.  Argument: none.

200   possible pipelining effects
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   A register is used in a series of instructions, so that a
                sequence of instructions probably does not generate the
                desired result. This usually happens when a register is
                used, before its new content was effectively loaded in it.
      Argument: the register probably causing the problem.

210   multiple use of address register in one instruction
      Type:     warning
      Reason:   An register used for the addressing is used once more in the
                same instruction, in a way that results in a modification
                of the register value. The resulting address does not have a
                well defined value.
      Argument: the register used more than once.

1000  symbol double defined
      Type:     error
      Reason:   A new value is assigned to a symbol, using a label or a
                EQU, PORT, SFR, LABEL, SFRB or BIT directive: however this
                can be done only using SET/EVAL.
      Argument: the name of the offending symbol, and the line number where
                it was defined for the first time, according to the symbol
                table.

1010  symbol undefined
      Type:     error
      Reason:   A symbol is still not defined in the symbol table, also
                after a second pass.
      Argument: the name of the undefined symbol.

1020  invalid symbol name
      Type:     error
      Reason:   A symbol does not fulfil the requirements that symbols
                must have, to be considered valid by AS. Please pay
                attention that more stringent syntax rules exist for
                Macros and function parameters.
      Argument: the wrong symbol

1090  invalid format
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The command options used do not exist for this command.
                (TLCS-9000 only)
      Argument: the known formats for this command

1100  useless attribute
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The command (processor or pseudo) cannot be used with a
                point-suffixed attribute.
      Argument: none

1105  attribute may only be one character long
      Type:     error

                neither longer, neither shorter than a character.
      Argument: none

1110  wrong number of operands
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The number of operands issued for the command (processor or

*** ACHTUNG !!! In MSG.ENG gibt es "undefiniert" statt "undefined". Bitte,
verbessere !!!

      Type:     error
      Reason:   It is not possible to estimate, from the opcode and from
                the operands, the size of the operand ( a trouble with
                8086 assembly). You must define it with a BYTE, WORD, o
                PTR- prefix.
      Argument: none

1135  invalid operand type
      Type:     error
      Reason:   an expression does not have a correct operand type

      Argument: none

1300  number of opening/closing brackets does not match
      Type:     error

                does not match.
      Argument: the wrong expression

1310  division by 0
      Type:     error

                maybe I will change this...)

1325  address is not properly aligned
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The given address does not correspond with the size needed
                by the data transfer, i.e. it is not an integer multiple of
                the operand size. Not all processor types can use unaligned
                data.
      Argument: none

1330  distance too big
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The displacement used for an address is too large.
      Argument: none

1340  short addressing not allowed
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The address of the operand is outside of the address space
                that can be accessed using short-addressing mode.
      Argument: none

1350  addressing mode not allowed here
      Type:     error
      Reason:   the addressing mode used here, although usually possible,

      Argument: none

1355  addressing mode not allowed in parallel operation
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The addressing mode(s) used are allowed in sequential,

                exist.
      Argument: none

1370  jump distance too big
      Type:     error
      Reason:   the jumping instruction and destination are too apart, to
                execute the jump with a single step
      Argument: none

1375  jump distance is odd
      Type:     error
      Reason:   Since instruction must be defined only at even addresses,
                the jump distance between two instructions must always be
                even, and the LSB of the jump distance is used otherwise.
                This issue was not verified here. The reason is usually the
                presence of an odd number of data in bytes or a wrong ORG.
      Argument: none

1380  invalid argument for shifting
      Type:     error

      Type:     error
      Reason:   Not all the sections were properly closed.
      Argument: none

1486  wrong ENDSECTION
      Type:     error
      Reason:   The given ENDSECTION does not refer to the most
                deeply nested one.

B. I/O error messages
=====================

The following error messages are generated not only by AS, but also from
the auxiliary programs, like PLIST, BIND, P2HEX, and P2BIN. Only the most
probable error messages are here explained. Should you meet an undocumented
error message, then you probably met a program bug ! Please inform us
immediately about this !!

2     file not found
      The file requested does not exist, or it is stored in another disk.

3     path not found
      The path of a file does not exist, or it is in another disk.

4     too much open files
      There are no more file handles available to DOS. Increase
      their number changing the value associated to FILES= in the file
      CONFIG.SYS.

5     file access not allowed
      Either the network access rights do not allow the file access, or
      an attempt was done to rewrite or rename a protected file.

100   Unexpected end of file
      A file access tried to go beyond the end of file, although according

      sometimes remove the protecting tab from your diskette !

151   unknown device
      you tried to access a peripherical unit that is unknown to DOS. This

      close the disk drive door.

153   unknown DOS function

154   invalid disk checksum
      A bad read error on the disk. Try again; if nothing changes,
      reformat the floppy disk, or begin to take care of your hard disk!

*** (DPB == FCB (file control block) - Bin ich richtig ?!?)

158   sector not found
      As nr. 156, but the controller this time could not find a disk
      sector in the track.

159   end of paper
      You probably redirected the output of AS to a printer. Assembler
      printout can be veeery long...
