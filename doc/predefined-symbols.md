To be exact, boolean symbols are just ordinary integer symbols with the difference that AS will assign only two different values to them (0 or 1, corresponding to False or True). AS does not store special symbols in the symbol table. For performance reasons, they are realized with hardcoded comparisons directly in the parser. They therefore do not show up in the assembly listing's symbol table. Predefined symbols are only set once at the beginning of a pass. The values of dynamic symbols may in contrast change during assembly as they reflect settings made with related pseudo instructions. The values added in parentheses give the value present at the beginning of a pass.

The names given in this table also reflect the valid way to reference these symbols in case-sensitive mode.

The names listed here should be avoided for own symbols; either one can define but not access them (special symbols), or one will receive an error message due to a double-defined symbol. The ugliest case is when the redefinition of a symbol made by AS at the beginning of a pass leads to a phase error and an infinite loop...
