<!-- markdownlint-disable MD030 -->

Here is a list of all error messages emitted by AS. Each error message
is described by:

- the internal error number (it is displayed only if AS is started with the `-n` option)
- the text of the error message
- error type:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning: informs the user that a possible error was found, or that some inefficient binary code could be generated. The assembly process is not stopped.
  - ‚õîError: an error was detected. The assembly process continues, but no binary code is emitted.
  - üíÄFatal: unrecoverable error. The assembly process is terminated.
- reason of the error: the situation originating the error.
- argument: a further explanation of the error message.

# I/O Error Messages

The following error messages are generated not only by AS, but also by the auxiliary programs, like PLIST, BIND, P2HEX, and P2BIN. Only the most probable error messages are here explained. Should you meet an undocumented error message, then you probably met a program bug! Please inform us immediately about this!!
